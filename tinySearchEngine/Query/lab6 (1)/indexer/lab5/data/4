<p style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;"><font style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Apple LiSung Light;" size="+2">Andrew T. Campbell is a professor of computer science at Dartmouth College were he co-directs the <a href="http://dartnets.cs.dartmouth.edu/">DartNets Lab</a> with <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/%7Exia/">Xia Zhou</a>.<br>
<br>
Prior to joining Dartmouth in 2005, Andrew was an associate professor of electrical engineering at <a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/%7Ecampbell/">Columbia University (1996-2005)</a> and a member of the COMET Group where he developed a number of early mobile networking technologies. <br>
<br>
Andrew is an experimental computer scientist working in the area of
ubiquitous computing. His current work is focused on turning the
everyday smartphone into a <a href="cognitivephone.pdf">cognitivephone</a>
by pushing intelligence to the phone and cloud to make inferences about
people's behavior, surroundings and their life patterns. Andrew is
interested in using smartphones to sense, inform and nudge people in a
better direction in terms of their physical and mental health; </font><font style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;" size="+2"><strong><font style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/">StudentLife</a> is a good example of computational </font></strong></font><font style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Apple LiSung Light;" size="+2"><strong><font style="font-weight: normal;">behavioral change technology</font></strong><br>
<br>
Mobile phone sensing is poised to be at the center of the next
revolution in social networks, mobile health care and well-being, green
applications and global environmental monitoring </font><font size="+2">-- see
his ACM MobiOpp 2010 keynote on
<a href="mobiopp-2010.pdf">mobile phone sensing is the next big thing</a>. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="+2"><span style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">Andrew is listed among </span><a style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;" href="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/%7Epalsberg/h-number.html">computer scientists</a><span style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;"> with an academic index (i.e., h-index) greater
than 40. The h-index is a method for ranking researchers based on impact -- see </span><a style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;" href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rthco5oAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google scholar profile</a><span style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;"> for his papers and citations</span>.<br>
<br style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">
</font><font style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Apple LiSung Light;" size="+2"><span style="font-family: AppleMyungjo;"><font size="+2"><span style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">He
received his Ph.D. in Computer Science (1996) from Lancaster
University, England, the NSF Career Award (1999) for his research in
programmable wireless networking and the IBM Faculty Award. He did his
Ph.D. on quality of service architecture for computer networks with his
advisor David Hutchison. Prior to joining academia he spent 10 years
working in the software industry in the US, UK and Netherlands,
developing operating systems and protocols for computer networks and
wireless packet networks.</span><br style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">
<br style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">
<span style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">After working in the
software industry for 10 years he went for a 6 month walk through
central America and decided to go back to school and get a PhD in
computer science with no intention of becoming an academic ;-)</span><br style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">
<br style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">
<span style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">Andrew has been a
technical program chair for ACM MobiCom, ACM MobiHoc and ACM SenSys;
and the general co-chair for ACM MobiSys and ACM SenSys 2006. He served
as SenSys steering committee chair between 2008-2009.&nbsp; He has also
served on editorial board for a number of leading ACM and IEEE journals
including ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communications Reviews, IEEE
Transactions on Mobile Computing and IEEE Transactions on Networking.
He is a co-chair for the NSF sponsored workshop on pervasive computing
at scale. Results from his research have been published widely in top
academic conferences and journals as well as other media such as the
New York Times Magazine and CBS News Sunday Morning.</span><br style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">
<br style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">
<span style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">Andrew spent his
sabbatical year (2003-2004) at the Computer Lab, Cambridge University,
as an EPSRC Visiting Fellow, and fall 2009 as a visiting professor at
the University of Salamanca, Spain.</span><br style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">
<br style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">
<span style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">One of the most exciting
and enjoyable parts of his professional life is working with absolutely
brilliant young students -- in fact it is the best part of what he
considers his day job. He has graduated 14 PhD students -- on paper he
was their advisor but in reality they were his.</span><br style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">
<br style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">
<span style="font-family: Apple LiSung Light;">Andrew lives in Norwich,
Vermont with his wife, Susan Zak, and their sons, Miles and Will; plays
squash and tenor sax and has ran ten marathons.</span></font><br>
