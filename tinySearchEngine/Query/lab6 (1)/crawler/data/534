<META NAME="abstract" CONTENT="We evaluate mobility predictors in wireless networks.  Handoff
prediction in wireless networks has long been considered as a mechanism
to improve the quality of service provided to mobile wireless users.
Most prior studies, however, were based on theoretical analysis,
simulation with synthetic mobility models, or small wireless network
traces.  We study the effect of mobility prediction for a large
realistic wireless situation.
  We tackle the problem by using traces collected from a large
production wireless network to evaluate several major families of
handoff-location prediction techniques, a set of handoff-time
predictors,  and a predictor that jointly predicts handoff location and
time. We also propose a fallback mechanism, which uses a lower-order
predictor whenever a higher-order predictor fails to predict.
  We found that low-order Markov predictors, with our proposed fallback
mechanisms, performed as well or better than the more complex and more
space-consuming compression-based handoff-location predictors.  Although
our handoff-time predictor had modest prediction accuracy, in the
context of mobile voice applications we found that bandwidth reservation
strategies can benefit from the combined location and time handoff
predictor, significantly reducing the call-drop rate without
significantly increasing the call-block rate.
  We also developed a prediction-based routing protocol for mobile
opportunistic networks.  We evaluated and compared our protocol's
performance to five existing routing protocols, using simulations driven
by real mobility traces. We found that the basic routing protocols are
not practical for large-scale opportunistic networks.  Prediction-based
routing protocols trade off the message delivery ratio against resource
usage and performed well and comparable
to each other.">

<b>Abstract:</b>
We evaluate mobility predictors in wireless networks.  Handoff
prediction in wireless networks has long been considered as a mechanism
to improve the quality of service provided to mobile wireless users.
Most prior studies, however, were based on theoretical analysis,
simulation with synthetic mobility models, or small wireless network
traces.  We study the effect of mobility prediction for a large
realistic wireless situation.
</P><P>
  We tackle the problem by using traces collected from a large
production wireless network to evaluate several major families of
handoff-location prediction techniques, a set of handoff-time
predictors,  and a predictor that jointly predicts handoff location and
time. We also propose a fallback mechanism, which uses a lower-order
predictor whenever a higher-order predictor fails to predict.
</P><P>
  We found that low-order Markov predictors, with our proposed fallback
mechanisms, performed as well or better than the more complex and more
space-consuming compression-based handoff-location predictors.  Although
our handoff-time predictor had modest prediction accuracy, in the
context of mobile voice applications we found that bandwidth reservation
strategies can benefit from the combined location and time handoff
predictor, significantly reducing the call-drop rate without
significantly increasing the call-block rate.
</P><P>
  We also developed a prediction-based routing protocol for mobile
opportunistic networks.  We evaluated and compared our protocol's
performance to five existing routing protocols, using simulations driven
by real mobility traces. We found that the basic routing protocols are
not practical for large-scale opportunistic networks.  Prediction-based
routing protocols trade off the message delivery ratio against resource
usage and performed well and comparable
to each other.
