<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I am a first year Ph.D. student in the <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu"> Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth College</a>. I am a member of the <a href="http://dartnets.cs.dartmouth.edu">DartNets</a> (Dartmouth Networking and Ubiquitous Systems) Lab, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~xia/">Prof. Xia Zhou</a>. I received my B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. (minor) in Economics from Peking University in July, 2013. During my senior year, I also went to UCLA as a research-exchange student.</p>
<p>My research interest focuses on mobile systems and wireless networking. Now, I am highly motivated by the topics on VLC (Visible Light Communication) testbed design and spectrum monitoring. Before joining DartNets, I was an undergraduate research assistant at the Center for Energy-efficient Computing and Applications (CECA), Peking University and conducted research on FPGA and SDR system (Software Defined Radio).</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Visible Light Communication (VLC) testbed</b>
<p>We build a flexible VLC system and make it a testbed for other researchers to develop new ideas on, such as mobile HCI.</p>
<li><b>Spectrum Monitering</b>
<p>We participate in the <a href="http://observatory.microsoftspectrum.com/Home/About">Microsoft Spectrum Observatory</a> and set up a base station in Sudikoff Lab. Microsoft has recently released a new version. Everyone now has access to the spectrum usage data and raw IQ data collected from stations all over the world.</p>
