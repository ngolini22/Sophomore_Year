<META NAME="abstract" CONTENT="Pervasive computing leads to an increased integration between the real world
and the computational world, and many applications in pervasive computing adapt to
the user's context, such as the location of the user and relevant devices, the
presence of other people, light or sound conditions, or available network
bandwidth, to meet a user's continuously changing requirements without taking
explicit input from the users.
	We consider a class of applications that wish to consider a user's context
when deciding whether to authorize a user's access to important physical or
information resources. Such a context-sensitive authorization scheme is
necessary when a mobile user moves across multiple administrative domains
where they are not registered in advance. Also, users interacting with their
environment need a non-intrusive way to access resources, and clues about
their context may be useful input into authorization policies for these
resources.  Existing systems for context-sensitive authorization take a
logic-based approach, because a logical language makes it possible to define a
context model where a contextual fact is expressed with a boolean predicate
and to derive higher-level context information and authorization decisions
from contextual facts. 
	However, those existing context-sensitive authorization systems have a central
server that collects context information, and evaluates policies to make
authorization decisions on behalf of a resource owner. A centralized solution
assumes that all resource owners trust the server to make correct decisions,
and all users trust the server not to disclose private context information.
In many realistic applications of pervasive computing, however, the resources,
users, and sources of context information are inherently distributed among
many organizations that do not necessarily trust each other.  Resource owners
may not trust the integrity of context information produced by another domain,
and context sensors may not trust others with the confidentiality of data they
provide about users. 
	In this thesis, we present a secure distributed proof system for
context-sensitive authorization. Our system enables multiple hosts to evaluate
an authorization query in a peer-to-peer way, while preserving the
confidentiality and integrity policies of mutually untrusted principals
running those hosts. We also develop a novel caching and revocation mechanism
to support context-sensitive policies that refer to information in dozens of
different administrative domains. Contributions of this thesis include the
definition of fine-grained security policies that specify trust relations
among principals in terms of information confidentiality and integrity, the
design and implementation of a secure distributed proof system, a proof for
the correctness of our algorithm, and a performance evaluation showing
that the amortized performance of our system scales to dozens of servers in
different domains. ">

<b>Abstract:</b>
Pervasive computing leads to an increased integration between the real world
and the computational world, and many applications in pervasive computing adapt to
the user's context, such as the location of the user and relevant devices, the
presence of other people, light or sound conditions, or available network
bandwidth, to meet a user's continuously changing requirements without taking
explicit input from the users.
</P><P>
	We consider a class of applications that wish to consider a user's context
when deciding whether to authorize a user's access to important physical or
information resources. Such a context-sensitive authorization scheme is
necessary when a mobile user moves across multiple administrative domains
where they are not registered in advance. Also, users interacting with their
environment need a non-intrusive way to access resources, and clues about
their context may be useful input into authorization policies for these
resources.  Existing systems for context-sensitive authorization take a
logic-based approach, because a logical language makes it possible to define a
context model where a contextual fact is expressed with a boolean predicate
and to derive higher-level context information and authorization decisions
from contextual facts. 
</P><P>
	However, those existing context-sensitive authorization systems have a central
server that collects context information, and evaluates policies to make
authorization decisions on behalf of a resource owner. A centralized solution
assumes that all resource owners trust the server to make correct decisions,
and all users trust the server not to disclose private context information.
In many realistic applications of pervasive computing, however, the resources,
users, and sources of context information are inherently distributed among
many organizations that do not necessarily trust each other.  Resource owners
may not trust the integrity of context information produced by another domain,
and context sensors may not trust others with the confidentiality of data they
provide about users. 
</P><P>
	In this thesis, we present a secure distributed proof system for
context-sensitive authorization. Our system enables multiple hosts to evaluate
an authorization query in a peer-to-peer way, while preserving the
confidentiality and integrity policies of mutually untrusted principals
running those hosts. We also develop a novel caching and revocation mechanism
to support context-sensitive policies that refer to information in dozens of
different administrative domains. Contributions of this thesis include the
definition of fine-grained security policies that specify trust relations
among principals in terms of information confidentiality and integrity, the
design and implementation of a secure distributed proof system, a proof for
the correctness of our algorithm, and a performance evaluation showing
that the amortized performance of our system scales to dozens of servers in
different domains.
