<META NAME="abstract" CONTENT="  Recent years have witnessed a new class of monitoring applications
that need to continuously collect information from remote data
sources. Those data sources, such as web click-streams, stock quotes,
and sensor data, are often characterized as fast-rate high-volume
``streams''. Distributed stream-processing systems are thus designed
to efficiently use system resources to serve the data-acquisition
needs of the applications. Most of the state-of-the-art
stream-processing systems assume an Ethernet-based network whose
bandwidth is abundant, and focus on mechanisms to save computational
power and memory. For applications involving wireless networks,
particularly multi-hop mesh networks, we recognize that the most
limiting factor in efficiently processing streams lies in the
network's highly constrained bandwidth. Hence, this dissertation
proposes a group-aware stream filtering approach that saves bandwidth
at the cost of increased CPU time, for low-bandwidth data-streaming
systems.
  This approach, used together with multicasting, exploits two
overlooked properties of monitoring applications: 1) many of them can
tolerate some degree of ``slack'' in their data quality requirements,
and 2) there may exist multiple subsets of the source data satisfying
the quality needs of an application. We can thus choose the ``best
alternative'' subset for each application to maximize the data overlap
within the group to best benefit from multicasting. After proving the
problem NP-hard, we introduce a suite of heuristics-based algorithms
that ensure data quality, specifically data granularity and
timeliness, in addition to preserving network bandwidth.
  Our framework for group-aware stream filtering is extensible and
supports a diverse range of filtering needs of monitoring
applications. We evaluate this approach with a prototype system based
on real-world data sets. The results show that quality-managed
group-aware filtering is effective in trading CPU time for bandwidth
savings, compared with self-interested stream filtering. We also
evaluate the effect of each algorithm on temporal freshness of the
data. Finally, we discuss other application realms that might benefit
from group-aware stream filtering.">

  Recent years have witnessed a new class of monitoring applications
that need to continuously collect information from remote data
sources. Those data sources, such as web click-streams, stock quotes,
and sensor data, are often characterized as fast-rate high-volume
``streams''. Distributed stream-processing systems are thus designed
to efficiently use system resources to serve the data-acquisition
needs of the applications. Most of the state-of-the-art
stream-processing systems assume an Ethernet-based network whose
bandwidth is abundant, and focus on mechanisms to save computational
power and memory. For applications involving wireless networks,
particularly multi-hop mesh networks, we recognize that the most
limiting factor in efficiently processing streams lies in the
network's highly constrained bandwidth. Hence, this dissertation
proposes a group-aware stream filtering approach that saves bandwidth
at the cost of increased CPU time, for low-bandwidth data-streaming
systems.
