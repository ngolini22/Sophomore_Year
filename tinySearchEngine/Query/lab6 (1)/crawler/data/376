<b>Location Privacy for Opportunistic Sensing through Population
Mapping</b>.
In preparation,
December,
2013.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Opportunistic sensing allows applications to ``task'' mobile
devices to measure context in a target region. For example, one could
leverage sensor-equipped vehicles to measure traffic or pollution levels on a
particular street, or users' mobile phones to locate (Bluetooth-enabled)
objects in their vicinity. In most proposed applications, context reports
include the time and location of the event, putting the privacy of users at
increased risk--even if identifying information has been removed from a
report, the accompanying time and location can reveal sufficient information
to deanonymize the user whose device sent the report. <P> We propose and
evaluate a novel spatiotemporal blurring mechanism based on tessellation and
clustering to protect users' privacy against the system while reporting
context. Our technique employs a notion of probabilistic k-anonymity;
it allows users to perform local blurring of reports efficiently
without an online anonymization server before the data is sent to the
system. The proposed scheme can control the degree of certainty in location
privacy and the quality of reports through a system parameter. %We describe
our technique in the context of \sys, our general-purpose architecture for
leveraging users' mobile devices for measuring context, while maintaining the
privacy of the users. We outline the architecture and security properties of
our approach, and evaluate our tessellation and clustering algorithm against
real mobility traces.</p>
