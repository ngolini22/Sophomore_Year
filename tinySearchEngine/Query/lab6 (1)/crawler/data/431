priority in distributed systems, to provide flexible and rational limitations
on the potential of an application, and to provide a lightweight structure

We develop mechanisms that distributively allocate computation among
mobile agents in two settings.
The first models a situation where users collectively own networked
computing resources and require priority enforcement.
We extend the allocation mechanism to allow
resource reservation to mitigate utility volatility.
The second, more general model relaxes the ownership assumption.
We apply our computational market to an open setting where a principal's
chief concern is revenue maximization.
	Our simulations compare the performance of market-based allocation
policies to traditional policies and relate the cost of ownership and
consumption separation.
We observe that our markets effectively prioritize applications'
performance, can operate under uncertainty and network delay, provide
metrics to balance network load, and allow measurement of
market-participation risk versus reservation-based computation.
	In addition to allocation problems, we investigate resource selection
to optimize execution time.
The problem is NP-complete if the costs and latencies are constant.
Both metrics' dependence on the chosen set complicates matters.
We study how a greedy approach, a novel heuristic, and a
shortest-constrained-path strategy perform in mobile-agent applications.
	Market-based computational-resource allocation fertilizes
applications where previously there was a dearth of motive for or means
of cooperation.
The rationale behind mobile-agent performance optimization is also useful
for resource allocation in general distributed systems where an application
has a sequence of dependent tasks or when data collection is expensive.">

<b>Abstract:</b>
Modern distributed systems scatter sensors, storage, and computation
throughout the environment.
Ideally these devices communicate and share resources, but there
is seldom motivation for a device's owner to yield control to another user.
We establish markets for computational resources
to motivate principals to share resources with arbitrary users, to enforce
priority in distributed systems, to provide flexible and rational limitations
on the potential of an application, and to provide a lightweight structure
to balance the workload over time and between devices.
As proof of concept, we implement a structure software agents
can use to discover and negotiate access to networked resources.
The structure separates discovery, authentication, and consumption
enforcement as separate orthogonal issues to give system
designers flexibility.
</P><P>
	Mobile agents represent informational and computational flow.
We develop mechanisms that distributively allocate computation among
mobile agents in two settings.
The first models a situation where users collectively own networked
computing resources and require priority enforcement.
We extend the allocation mechanism to allow
resource reservation to mitigate utility volatility.
The second, more general model relaxes the ownership assumption.
We apply our computational market to an open setting where a principal's
chief concern is revenue maximization.
